# Parkinson-s-Disease-Detection
Detecting Parkinson’s Disease with XGBoost.
------------------------------------------
About:
-----
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system affecting movement and inducing tremors and stiffness. It has 5 stages to it and affects more than 1 million individuals every year in India. This is chronic and has no cure yet. It is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting dopamine-producing neurons in the brain.

So I built a model to accurately detect the presence of Parkinson’s disease in an individual.

XGBoost:
-------
XGBoost is a new Machine Learning algorithm designed with speed and performance in mind. XGBoost stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting and is based on decision trees. In this project, I imported the XGBClassifier from the xgboost library; this is an implementation of the scikit-learn API for XGBoost classification.

In this project, using the python libraries scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and xgboost, I did some plotting and built a model using an XGBClassifier. I loaded the data, grabbed the features and labels, scaled the features, then splitted the dataset, built an XGBClassifier, and then calculated the accuracy and classification report of the model.
